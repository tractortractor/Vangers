<h1>What do you need to play</h1>
<ol>
	<li>Download "data", "libraries" and "executables" folders from latest release on github.</li>
	<li>Extract and move all contents of those folders to folder with your current installation of Vangers. Replace if files already exists.</li>
	<li>Launch one of executables.</li>
</ol>

<h1>Applies to all builds</h1>

<h4>Mini-map legend:</h4>
<ul>
	<li>Big arrow - vanger.</li>
	<li>Small orange arrow - fish.</li>
	<li>Small red arrow - Jablee.</li>
	<li>Small green square - item.</li>
	<li>Big square with yellow borders - larva.</li>
	<li>Big green empty square - passive swarm.</li>
	<li>Big orange empty square - active swarm.</li>
	<li>Green dot - beeb.</li>
	<li>Orange dot - bullet.</li>
</ul>

<h4>zRECORDER, replays</h4>
<p>IMPORTANT! Backup saves and options before playing replays. Save file will be overwritten during playing of replay if replay creator saved the game during recording. Other settings may be changed in similar way. If you are using all_debug_cheats or vangers_debug builds then replay can also change "*.prm" files. Saves are stored in "savegame" folder. Options are stored in "game.dat" and "controls.dat" files.</p>
<br/>
<p>Records player's action if command line argument "w" or "W" is specified. File where to write must be specified right after this argument. Example: "/wfile_where_to_save", "/Wother_file_where_to_save".</p>
<p>Loads player's action if command line argument "p" or "P" is specified. File where to read from must be specified right after this argument. Example: "/pfile_where_to_read", "/Pother_file_where_to_read". Any control action which is not mouse moving, releasing keyboard button or releasing mouse button will stop playback.</p>
<br/>
<p>Replays should be played with same build of vangers which were used for recording.</p>
<p>It is unknown if replays are cross-platform, so it's a good idea to specify your OS while posting them.</p>
<p>Options which are ok to modify while recording: all camera options, autorun, deformable landscape. Modification of other options may mess up recording/playing.</p>
<br/>
<p>RNG seeds, controls and some options are saved in replay file.</p>
<p>While recording with joystick, replay size will be several times bigger.</p>
<p>While "GamePad" mode is on the game will record joystick movement events only when axis changes direction.</p>
<p>Mouse movements are not recorded so game interface does not react to them while recording.</p>
<p>While recording it's possible to steal counselor's items through walls.</p>

<h4>Controls for other features:</h4>
<ul>
	<li>"ctrl"/"shift" + "t" - Messes up time. Makes it too slow/fast.</li>
	<li>"ctrl" + "f" - Show fps and player's coordinates.</li>
</ul>

<h1>Basic builds' description</h1>

<p>"Executables" folder contains several builds. There are 2 types of executable folders: minor and major. Major one contains all interesting or important ones. Minor one contains boring builds or builds which do not affect the game much.</p>

	<li>
		<h3>aci_skip_mainmenu</h3>
		<p>Skip main menu initialization and starts new game instantly. Going back to menu also skips it and starts new game.</p>
		<p>Settings which are set from in-game menu are not remembered while starting the game this way.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<h3>aci_skip_shop</h3>
		<p>When starting new game or loading, escave initialization is skipped and player's vanger goes to world instantly. While going back to escave it's initialised like in base game.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<h3>aci_skip_shop_and_mainmenu</h3>
		<p>Combines aci_skip_mainmenu and aci_skip_shop.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<h3>aci_skip_shop_and_main_menu_and_load_on_start</h3>
		<p>Same as aci_skip_shop_and_mainmenu but loads first save instead of starting new game. First slot is at the top in save/load menus.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<h3>diagen_test</h3>
		<p>Loads dialog related variables from "data.lst" if present. Makes all variables non-updatable. See "DATA_UPDATABLE" below.</p>
		<p>Prints dialog name, dialog mood (speech mode) and dialog itself in the console.</p>
		<h4>Controls:</h4>
		<ul>
			<li>"5" - Next dialog line is printed in the console and skipped in game.</li>
			<li>"6" - Same as previous but done 24 times.</li>
			<li>"7" - Get list of available questions.</li>

			<li>"FINISH" - Stop current dialog sequence.</li>
			<li>"STATUS" - Prints world name, escave name, room name, counselor name and level. Range of values for the level is 0-2. Higher level - more respect for player.</li>
			<li>"ASK &ltentry&gt" - Ask available question. "ASK Agent", for example. See "7" above.</li>
			<li>"ESTATUS &ltlevel&gt" - Change eleepods' level to specified variable. It's the same level that is printed while invoking STATUS command. "ESTATUS 0", for example.</li>
			<li>"BSTATUS &ltlevel&gt" - Same as ESTATUS but for beeboorats.</li>
			<li>"ZSTATUS &ltlevel&gt" - Same as ESTATUS but for zeexs.</li>
			<li>"SSTATUS &ltlevel&gt" - Same as ESTATUS but for spectators.</li>
			<li>"SAVE" - Save dialog related data in "diagen_saveff.txt" file. Should be viewed with hex editor since values are in raw bytes.</li>
			<li>"LOAD" - Load dialog related data from "diagen_loadff.txt" file.</li>
		</ul>
		<br/>
		<p>Next console commands are dealing with dialog variables.</p>
		<p>Each time dialog starts or updates through console commands, dialog variables are updated from global variables. There is filter array which is used to prevent manually set dialog variables from being updated.</p>
		<ul>
			<li>"DATA &ltdialog data index&gt &ltnew value&gt" - Set dialog data found by index to specified new value, make this value non-updatable, then perform "DATALIST" action. Both input values must be integers. See "DATALIST".</li>
			<li>"DATALIST" - Save variables list in "data.lst" file. You can modify those variables with "DATA" and "DATALIST0" commands. visitCounter and comingCounter are not part of data list, so they are not modifiable with mentioned commands. Use "VISIT" to modify them.</li>
			<li>"DATALIST0" - Set all variables in data list to 0 and make them non-updatable then perform "DATALIST" action.</li>
			<li>"DATALIST_READABLE" - Save variables in readable form in "readable_data.lst". ID, name and updatability are specified for each variable. Cannot be used as "data.lst" to load variables in game.</li>
			<li>"DATALIST0_READABLE" - Same as "DATALIST0" but saving in readable form in "readable_data.lst" file. Completely useless in practice.</li>
			<li>"DATA_UPDATABLE &ltdialog data index&gt &ltupdatable&gt" - Change updatability of specified variable. Value of updatable dialog variable will be always overwritten by global variable.</li>
			<li>"DATA_UPDATABLE_ALL &ltupdatable&gt" - Change updatability of all variables.</li>

		<h4>Notes:</h4>
