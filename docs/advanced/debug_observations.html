<h2>All</h2>

<h3>Joystick is now supported</h3>

<p>There are 2 things which are controlled by joystick: traction and rudder.</p>

<h4>On first joystick setup screen you can choose joystick mode:</h4>
<ol>
    <li>NONE - Joystick does not affect traction or rudder. Alternative actions are still active though.</li>
    <li>GamePad - Any change of axis position causes maximum change of control value. Basically the same as "Joystick" with max sensitivity.</li>
    <li>Joystick - Rudder or traction control values changes proportionally to current axes states. Sensitivity settings affects this mode only.</li>
    <li>Steering Wheel - It's supposed to be the same as "Joystick" but without traction axis. Since it's just complete downgrade I decided to not restore this mode but instead leave old broken control code. It's quite fun to try for couple of minutes.</li>
</ol>

<p>Now there is a second screen in joystick options where you can set which axis controls traction and which axis controls rudder.</p>
<p>To set an axis, click on axis name and move desired axis further than 15/16 of max state. Direction of axis movement determines whether it's inverted.</p>
<p>You can also set sensitivity here.</p>

<p>On first screen of joystick controls you can set key which activates alternative joystick actions.</p>
<p>As long as key is assigned to this activation it cannot be assigned anywhere else.</p>
<p>When this key is pressed positions of assigned axes does not affect traction or rudder but other actions may be triggered. Let's say joystick enters alternative mode in this case.</p>
<p>To assign action on joystick movement in alternative mode go to "customize controls" screen, select control for some action, press and hold "alternative joystick action" button, move one of assigned axes.</p>

<h3>Mini-map</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Added fishes, farmers, hordes and bullets on mini-map.</li>
	<li>Added ability to see facing direction for all vangers, fishes and farmers on mini-map.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Boot Sector artifact tweaks</h3>
<p>In original there is need to constantly drop rubbox while changing mechoses and there is no easy way to use Boot Sector on Glorx without being ruBeecated.</p>
<p>To deal with this annoyance rubbox is now transferred to new mechos while teleporting to it with Boot Sector.</p>

<h3>Other:</h3>
<ul>
	<li>"ctrl"/"shift" + "t" - Messes up time. Makes it too slow/fast.</li>
	<li>"ctrl" + "f" - Show fps and player's coordinates.</li>
</ul>

<p>Ability to see larvae/dollies on mini-map while Dominance is more than 0. You need more than 50 in original.</p>
<p>Originally, ability to see items on mini-map. Now it's always here in all cases.</p>
<p>While camera is still, there is different rendering for landscape.</p>
<p>Key to the next inhabited world is gained as soon as key giving line is available. Key giving line is blocked by first greeting at Podish and by ruBeecation at VigBoo.</p>
<p>Number of bytes of RAM allocated for this game is saved in "memstats.dmp".</p>

<h3>SICHER_DEBUG</h3>
<p>Not defined anywhere.</p>
<p>Defines NO_BORDER_FIELD.</p>
<p>Probably "SICHER" is nickname of game developer Alexander "Sicher" Kotliar.</p>
<p>Flying, digging and swimming requires no special items.</p>
<h4>All controls are default:</h4>
<ul>
	<li>"Up" - Move forward.</li>
	<li>"Down" - Move backward.</li>
	<li>"Shift" - Acceleration.</li>
	<li>"x" - Handbrake.</li>

	<li>"Home" - Turn device DOWN.</li>
</ul>
<br/>
<p>There are 3 special switches. Once fish/skyfarmer switch is on there is no way to turn it off since almost all controls are blocked. Only relaunching the game will unblock game controls.</p>
<p>fish/skyfarmer test switch makes player's mechos and everything close to it, behave like fish/skyfarmer. No other special behavior. Player's vanger is just swimming/flying at one direction.</p>
<p>In this build "stop" switch does nothing.</p>
<h4>Controls:</h4>
<ul>
	<li>"g" - Activate fish test switch.</li>
	<li>"h" - Activate skyfarmer test switch.</li>

<p>AI paths indications of UNIT_DEBUG_VIEW are handled differently. Although changes are not visible.</p>



<h3>iMOVE_MOUSE_OBJECTS</h3>
<p>Not defined anywhere.</p>
<p>When hovering mouse over button it becomes selected.</p>
<p>Coordinates of selected button are printed at right-bottom of the screen.</p>
<p>Selected button can be moved around.</p>
<p>Moving outside of the screen crashes the game if moved by y coordinate.</p>

<h4>Controls are changed from the original to deal with conflicting buttons:</h4>

<h3>DIAGEN_TEST</h3>
<p>Loads dialog related variables from "data.lst" if present. Makes all variables non-updatable. See "DATA_UPDATABLE" below.</p>
<p>Prints dialog name, dialog mood (speech mode) and dialog itself in the console.</p>
<p>Creates "Check.LOG" text file where all unused lines are listed.</p>
<p>Creates "diagen_new.text" with all in-game text loaded. This file is almost identical to currently used "diagen.text/diagen_eng.text".</p>
<p>Originally with this test mode data was loaded from "room.lst" file. Since I was not able to figure out how to obtain this file, this feature is now removed from this build. Text data is now loaded from "diagen.text/diagen_eng.text" file.</p>
<h4>Controls:</h4>
<ul>
	<li>"5" - Next dialog line is printed in the console and skipped in game.</li>
	<li>"6" - Same as previous but done 24 times.</li>
	<li>"7" - Get list of available questions.</li>
	<li>"8" - All available questions are asked and answered in the console.</li>
	<li>"9" - Game process stops and waits for console input (std::cin). Input is saved but not used.</li>
	<li>"0" - Use last received console input.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Console commands:</h4>
<ul>
	<li>"GO &ltescave name&gt" - Dialog-wise treat current escave as specified for this visit. Names match is case-sensitive. Possible escave names are: Podish, Incubator, VigBoo, Lampasso, Ogorod, ZeePa, B-Zone, Spobs, Threall. "GO Ogorod", for example.</li>
	<li>"FINISH" - Stop current dialog sequence.</li>
	<li>"STATUS" - Prints world name, escave name, room name, counselor name and level. Range of values for the level is 0-2. Higher level - more respect for player.</li>
	<li>"ASK &ltentry&gt" - Ask available question. "ASK Agent", for example. See "7" above.</li>
	<li>"ESTATUS &ltlevel&gt" - Change eleepods' level to specified variable. It's the same level that is printed while invoking STATUS command. "ESTATUS 0", for example.</li>
	<li>"BSTATUS &ltlevel&gt" - Same as ESTATUS but for beeboorats.</li>
	<li>"ZSTATUS &ltlevel&gt" - Same as ESTATUS but for zeexs.</li>
	<li>"SSTATUS &ltlevel&gt" - Added feature. Same as ESTATUS but for spectators.</li>
	<li>"SAVE" - Save dialog related data in "diagen_saveff.txt" file. Should be viewed with hex editor since values are in raw bytes.</li>
	<li>"LOAD" - Load dialog related data from "diagen_loadff.txt" file.</li>
</ul>
<br/>
<p>Next console commands are dealing with dialog variables.</p>
<p>Originally 2 variable arrays were used by dialog system. First contained global variables and second contained dialog variables. Dialog functions directly queried global variables while those console commands modified dialog variables. Dialog variables were never used, so next commands were completely useless.</p>
<p>In this version dialog variables are used by dialog functions. Each time dialog starts or updates through console commands, dialog variables are updated from global variables. There is also filter array which is used to prevent manually set dialog variables from being updated.</p>
<ul>
	<li>"DATA &ltdialog data index&gt &ltnew value&gt" - Set dialog data found by index to specified new value, make this value non-updatable, then perform "DATALIST" action. Both input values must be integers. See "DATALIST".</li>
	<li>"DATALIST" - Save variables list in "data.lst" file. You can modify those variables with "DATA" and "DATALIST0" commands. visitCounter and comingCounter are not part of data list, so they are not modifiable with mentioned commands. Use "VISIT" instead.</li>
	<li>"DATALIST0" - Set all variables in data list to 0 and make them non-updatable then perform "DATALIST" action.</li>
	<li>"DATALIST_READABLE" - Added feature. Save variables in readable form in "readable_data.lst". ID, name and updatability are specified for each variable. Cannot be used as "data.lst" to load variables in game.</li>
	<li>"DATALIST0_READABLE" - Added feature. Same as "DATALIST0" but saving in readable form in "readable_data.lst" file. Completely useless in practice.</li>
	<li>"DATA_UPDATABLE &ltdialog data index&gt &ltupdatable&gt" - Added feature. Change updatability of specified variable. Value of updatable dialog variable will be always overwritten by global variable.</li>
	<li>"DATA_UPDATABLE_ALL &ltupdatable&gt" - Added feature. Change updatability of all variables.</li>
	<li>
		<p>"MAP" - Prints dialogs map in console.</p>
		<ul>
			<p>Legend:</p>
			<li>space - EMPTY - Unoccupied space.</li>
			<li>"D" - DORMANT - Currently uninvolved.</li>
			<li>"U" - USED - Already used.</li>
			<li>"W" - WAITING - Active, waiting to be checked.</li>
			<li>"O" - OPENED - Active with access.</li>
			<li>"E" - EXPLODED - Involved.</li>
			<li>skipped while mapped - HALFLIFE - Waiting for end (repeatable = 1).</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>"VISIT &ltescave ID&gt &ltvisitCounter&gt &ltcomingCounter&gt" - Change visitCounter and comingCounter of specified escave to specified values. Escave ID is first symbol of name, case-sensitive. See "GO" above for full list of names. visitCounter and comingCounter values are never actually used.</li>
</ul>
<br/>

<p>Turns off music during gameplay. Menus are not affected.</p>



<h3>zRECORDER_ENABLED</h3>
<p>Not defined anywhere.</p>
<br/>
<p>IMPORTANT! Backup saves and options before playing replays. Save file will be overwritten during playing of replay if replay creator saved the game during recording. Other settings may be changed in similar way. If your build is compiled with ENTRIES_CONTROL and MSG_OUT macros then replay can also change "*.prm" files. Saves are stored in "savegame" folder. Options are stored in "game.dat" and "controls.dat" files.</p>
<br/>
<p>Records player's action if command line argument "w" or "W" is specified. File where to write must be specified right after this argument. Example: "/wfile_where_to_save", "/Wother_file_where_to_save".</p>
<p>Loads player's action if command line argument "p" or "P" is specified. File where to read from must be specified right after this argument. Example: "/pfile_where_to_read", "/Pother_file_where_to_read". Any control action which is not mouse moving, releasing keyboard button or releasing mouse button will stop playback.</p>
<br/>
<p>Replays should be played with same build of vangers which were used for recording.</p>
<p>It is unknown if replays are cross-platform, so it's a good idea to specify your OS while posting them.</p>
<p>Options which are ok to modify while recording: all camera options, autorun, deformable landscape. Modification of other options may mess up recording/playing.</p>
<br/>
<p>RNG seeds, controls and some options are stored in replay file.</p>
<p>Each controls event takes 8 bytes to record. For example event is created each time button is pressed or released.</p>
<p>While recording with joystick, replay size will be several times bigger, since any stick move creates new event.</p>
<p>While "GamePad" mode is on the game will record joystick movement events only when axis changes direction.</p>
<p>Mouse movements are not recorded so game interface does not react to them while recording.</p>
<p>While recording it's possible to steal counselor's items through walls. This was made to deal with absence of mouse movements while recording and to make replays more interesting to watch.</p>



<h3>_XRECORDER_LOG_</h3>
<p>Not defined anywhere.</p>
<p>Logs recorder state.</p>
<h4>Files:</h4>
<ul>
	<li>"xrec_wr.log" - normally.</li>
	<li>"xrec_pl.log" - while playing prerecorded actions.</li>
</ul>



<h3>_RTO_LOG_</h3>
<p>Not defined anywhere.</p>
<p>Logs data about runtime objects changes.</p>
<h4>Files:</h4>
<ul>
	<li>"xt_rto_w.log" - normally.</li>
	<li>"xt_rto_p.log" - while playing prerecorded actions.</li>
</ul>



<h3>AML_DEBUG</h3>
<p>Not defined anywhere.</p>
<p>Logs interface events.</p>
<h4>Files:</h4>
<ul>
	<li>"iml_wr.log" - normally.</li>
	<li>"iml_pl.log" - while playing prerecorded actions.</li>
</ul>



<h3>TERRAIN16</h3>
<p>Not defined anywhere.</p>
<p>Will compile only if ACTINT is defined.</p>
<p>World's "*.ini" files must contain "Terrain Max" parameter with value "16" in "Rendering Parameters" section.</p>
<p>World's "level.lst" files must contain 16 DestroyTerrain entries instead of 8.</p>
<p>Messes up types of terrains on worlds.</p>
<p>Probably, makes the game use 16 types of terrains instead of 8.</p>

<h3>XGR_SUPPRESS_HICOLOR</h3>
<p>Not defined anywhere.</p>
<p>Suppresses highcolor interface drawing. Since nothing actually triggers highcolor mode, this macro is useless.</p>



<h3>_LARGE_MODEL_</h3>
<p>Not defined anywhere.</p>
<p>Changes predefined variables for zip compressor functions.</p>

<h3>_STATIC_TABLES_</h3>
<p>Not defined anywhere.</p>
<p>Use precomputed value tables for some 3d calculations.</p>

<h3>XSTRDUP</h3>
<p>Not defined anywhere.</p>
<p>Use own "strdup" implementation for "xstrdup" function instead of standard one. Supposed to be defined if standard "strdup" function is not available.</p>

<h3>_MT_</h3>
<p>Not defined anywhere.</p>
<p>Changes 3d objects' scaling.</p>
<p>Redefines "random(num)" function-like macro in "src/3d/3d_math.h".</p>

<h3>_GENERATE_MATRIX_SHAPES_</h3>
<p>Not defined anywhere.</p>
<p>Generates "*.bmp", "*.pal" and "*.shp" files in "actint/temp" folder each time world is visited. Crashes if can't output here. Then if _GENERATE_EXIT_ is defined exits the game.</p>

<h3>_GENERATE_iMATRIX_SHAPES_</h3>
<p>Not defined anywhere.</p>
<p>Same as _GENERATE_MATRIX_SHAPES_ but somewhat different. If both are defined as well as _GENERATE_EXIT_ then game exits before executing _GENERATE_iMATRIX_SHAPES_ code. If _GENERATE_EXIT_ is not defined code of both macros is executed.</p>

<h3>_GENERATE_ITEM_DATA_</h3>
<p>Not defined anywhere.</p>
<p>Creates windows batch files "i_items.bat" and "items.bat" in "actint/temp" folder each time world is visited.</p>
<p>Apparently those batch files assumes that there is "tga" folder with "tga" file for each item.</p>
<p>If executed "i_items.bat" calls "r.bat" for each "tga" file specifying file name, ScreenSizeX and ScreenSizeY of this item. Then calls "g.bat".</p>
<p>"items.bat" does the same thing but calls "r1.bat" instead of "r.bat" and "g1.bat" instead of "g.bat".</p>
<p>If _GENERATE_EXIT_ is defined game exits right after file generation.</p>
<h4>Controls:</h4>
<ul>
	<li>"I" - create batch files.</li>
</ul>

<h3>_GENERATE_EXIT_</h3>
<p>Not defined anywhere.</p>
<p>Previously defined in "src/actint/ascr_fnc.cpp".</p>
<p>Modifies behavior of _GENERATE_MATRIX_SHAPES_, _GENERATE_iMATRIX_SHAPES_ and _GENERATE_ITEM_DATA_ macros.</p>



<h3>SAVE_TNT_DATA</h3>
<p>Not defined anywhere.</p>
<p>Each time world is visited tries to read specific data from "thechain/*world name*/out.vl" and save it to "thechain/*world name*/tnttable.vlc".</p>

<h3>_FACET_FLOOR_</h3>
<p>Not defined anywhere.</p>
<p>Modifies "generate_floor" function which is used only when _GENERATE_MATRIX_SHAPES_ or _GENERATE_iMATRIX_SHAPES_ are defined.</p>
<p>Probably changes output of code of those macros.</p>

<h3>SAVE_EXPLOSION</h3>
<p>Not defined anywhere.</p>
<p>Saves all explosions in "Expl*.bmp" files in game directory. "*" is number of explosion.</p>

<h3>GLOBAL_TIMER</h3>
<p>Not defined anywhere.</p>
<h4>Uses:</h4>
<ul>
	<li>"tgame.lst" file instead of "game.lst".</li>
	<li>"tlevel.lst" file instead of "level.lst".</li>
	<li>"tlocation.lst" file instead of "location.lst".</li>
</ul>
<p>There are no such files so the game will crash.</p>
